This project harnesses the styles awesomeness of the [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com) framework with Dojo Toolkit powerful UI widgets.

- The same folder structure of the Semantic UI has been copied and used throughout this project.

- Every Dijit component will require / import a relevant Semantic Ui component, if any.

Try [live demo](http://websemantics.github.io/semantic-dojo).
